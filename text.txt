evict method is used
@Transactional

it make sure that the method or class or interface must follow the database rules, either the whole transaction should occur or none of it.
if any sort of exception occurs the whole transaction should roll back.
also it maintains a hibernate session

e.g

try{
    userTransaction.start();
    businessLogic();
    userTransaction.commit();
} catch(Excepton ex) {
    ex.rollback();
}

all of this is done the above annotation.
